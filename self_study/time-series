#periodogram
#stremgth of frequencies in time series

#seasonality
#indicators vs fourier features

  #seasonal indicators
    #binary features that represent seasonal difference - one hot encoding used to make these

X = pd.DataFrame(ohe.fit_transform(df), index = None, columns = None)
index - vertical axis
columns - horizontal axis
df = stuff I want to one hot encode

or pd.get_dummies(Series)
