#XGBoost and Data leakage in intermed ml

#target leakage: data collected after the point of prediction is used as training data. gives nonsensical results like "people who took antibiotics are likely to get pneumonia"
#actually lots of people who took antibiotics took it BECAUSE they got pneumonia

#train-test contamination: validation/test data got incorporated in training data. good training results but performs poorly when applied to different data setsã„º
